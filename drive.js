/**
 * ====================================================================
 * PlanSphere — the copy that lives in Google Drive
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The browser stays the working store. It is instant, it works with no
 * network and no account, and PlanSphere is fully usable if this file
 * never loads at all. Drive is the *second* copy: the one that survives a
 * cleared browser, and the one you can pull down onto another machine or
 * a phone.
 *
 * That ordering is the whole design. A planner that cannot open because
 * Google is having a bad morning is a worse planner than one that keeps
 * its trips locally and sends them up when asked.
 *
 * What goes up is exactly what Export writes — the same envelope, the same
 * format field. So a file pulled off Drive can be fed to Import, and a
 * file made by Export can be dropped into the Drive folder by hand. One
 * format, three routes in.
 *
 * On scope: this asks for `drive.file`, which grants access only to files
 * this app itself created. It cannot read your other documents and it
 * cannot list your Drive. That is deliberate, and it is also why it needs
 * no review from Google — the wider scopes do.
 * ====================================================================
