/**
 * ====================================================================
 * PlanSphere — where the records actually live
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This was `localStorage` directly, and localStorage has one hard problem:
 * browsers cap it at about 5 MB per **origin**, and no setting anywhere
 * raises it.
 *
 * For most apps that is roomy. For this one it is not, and the reason is
 * pictures. A trip cover, a receipt off the camera, a boarding pass, a
 * file attached to a stop — every one of them is stored as a data URL in
 * the same blob as the plan. They are resized on the way in, so a phone
 * photograph lands at a few tens of kilobytes rather than four megabytes,
 * but a trip with thirty receipts on it is still a trip that can fill
 * five megabytes and then fail to save. Silently, because a full
 * localStorage throws on write and the app carries on with figures that
 * are no longer written down anywhere.
 *
 * IndexedDB, in the same browser and the same origin, is offered a share
 * of free disk instead — measured in gigabytes rather than megabytes, for
 * no loss of anything. It works offline, it needs no account, and it is
 * just as instant.
 *
 * The catch is that it is asynchronous, and this app reads its records
 * synchronously. So:
 *
 *   **Everything is mirrored in memory.** `init()` reads the record out of
 *   IndexedDB once, before the first paint. After that `get` is a plain
 *   object lookup — synchronous and instant, so `load()` and `save()` in
 *   app.js kept the shape they always had.
 *
 *   **Writes never block.** `set` updates the mirror synchronously and
 *   queues the disk write. Nothing here has ever read a value back
 *   immediately after writing it, so nothing waits.
 *
 *   **Writes are coalesced.** Typing in a form fires a save per keystroke;
 *   only the last one needs to reach the disk.
 *
 * The holiday and rate caches deliberately stay in localStorage. They are
 * disposable, they are wanted before the first paint, and they are not
 * records — losing them costs one fetch.
 *
 * If IndexedDB is missing or refuses to open, this falls back to
 * localStorage and the app is exactly what it was.
